1. Define a function max() that takes two numbers as arguments and returns the largest of them. Use the if-then-else construct available in Javascript.
2. Define a function maxOfThree() that takes three numbers as arguments and returns the largest of them.
3. Write a function isVowel() that takes a character (i.e. a string of length 1) and returns true if it is a vowel, false otherwise.
4. Define a function sum() and a function multiply() that sums and multiplies (respectively) all the numbers in an array of numbers. For example, sum([1,2,3,4]) should return 10, and multiply([1,2,3,4]) should return 24.
5. Define a function reverse() that computes the reversal of a string. For example, reverse("jag testar") should return the string "ratset gaj".
6. Write a function findLongestWord() that takes an array of words and returns the length of the longest one.
7. Write a function filterLongWords() that takes an array of words and an integer i and returns the array of words that are longer than i.
8. Implement indexOf, lastIndexOf, includes, split using for loops without built-in functions for strings and arrays.
9. Implement slice and splice for Arrays.
